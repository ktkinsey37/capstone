To Do:


Create form for user to add report to backcast
Tidy up how backcasts look (line up side by side at least)
JS feature that allows you to hide show the full backcast (can then just have full backcasts always show? maybe make it an ajax request?)
ID the logic for snowy mountains
Build a backcast for mountains


Ideas for storing backcast:
-process it and store it without excess weather: "is_too_wet":"True"



Assessment for mountains:

Find high temperature,
find average temperature,
find total precip,
find avg precip
